I have created a scene of Elvet Bridge and the boat club bar, including moving boats on the river.
Each model is textured or coloured accordingly.
The shaders apply the textures and colors, and apply both directional and ambient lighting to the models.
The camera can be moved with WASD, QE and the arrow keys, according to the instructions on screen.
Note: The camera and models may appear to be "lagging", as a long time is spent drawing each frame.

To run the code:
Make sure you have node installed.
Run npm install and npm start to start the server.
In your browser, go to localhost:8080/boatclub.html.
You can also just open the boatclub.html file in your browser, and this will work too, but only in firefox.
Note: The scene runs much more smoothly in firefox, however it does not break entirely in chrome.
You can now use the keys shown on screen to manipulate the scene.
